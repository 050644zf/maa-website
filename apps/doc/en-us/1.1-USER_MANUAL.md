# MAA User Manual

## Features

### Operations

- If there is no stage you need, please click **blue start button** manually and select `current/previous`. (The previous stage will be entered if you are not in the **blue start button** screen.)
- When any of the `Sanity Potion`, `Originite Prime`, `Times`, `Drops` conditions are met, the task is considered completed and stops.
  - Example 1：check `Sanity Potion`: `999`, `Originite Prime`: `10`, `Times`: `1`. After **ONE** operation is completed, the task stops because `Times`: `1` is met.
  - Example 2：uncheck `Sanity Potion` and `Originite Prime`, and set `Times`: `100`. After sanity is used up (maybe several times), the condition `Sanity Potion` and `Originite Prime` is met, and the task stops.
- You can enable `Stage selection` in `Settings` - `UI Settings`, which supports all stages in main stories, and the stages in the dropdown list, such as `1-7`, `S3-2`, `CE-6`, etc.
- Supports recognizing and displaying drops, and auto-uploading operation statistics to [Penguin Stats](https://penguin-stats.io/) with custom Penguin Stats ID.
- `Drops` and `Stages` are two different options: `Drops` is to limit the times of battle such as "stop after 5 Orirock drops". It will not help direct you to the target stage.
- Supports auto-reconnection after disconnection, and auto-reconnection after 4 AM, continuing with the battle going on.
- Annihilation support with `PRTS`.
- Supports operator level-up, and supports handling PRTS failure by abandoning the operation.

### Infrastructure

#### Shifting Strategy

Auto-calculate and choose the **optimal solution within a single facility**. Supports all general and special skill combination. Supports recognition of Battle Record, Pure Gold, Originium Shard, Chip, etc. for different operators.

#### Morale Threshold for Working in Infrastructure

Recognize the percentage of the Morale progress bar. When Morale decreases beyond some threshold, move the operator to the dormitory.

#### Note

- The shifting strategy is based on the optimal solution within a single facility instead of multiple facilities. Combination such as: `Shamare-Tequila`, `Vermeil-Scene` within a single facility can be recognized correctly; while combination like `Rosmontis`, `Pinus Sylvestris` among facilities is not supported yet.
- If `Usage of Drone` is selected with the option `Trading Post-LMD`, it will recognize `Shamare` and reserve it for her.
- Operators of corresponding fraction will be selected when only one Clue is needed Reception Room; otherwise general operators will be chosen.
- Reception Room will send out Clues only when your Clues are full. Three Clues will be send out at most. You can edit `SelectClue` - `maxTimes` field in `resource/tasks.json` to edit number of Clues sent if you want.
- If you do not want operators like `Irene` or someone else to be put into the dormitory when the training room is not in use, you can switch off `Working operator shall not be put into the dormitory` in the settings. Note that this may cause the operators with non-full fatigue not entering the dormitory as well.
- Due to the complexity of Control Center, only `Amiya`, `Swire`, `Kal'tsit`, `Team Rainbow` and other Morale+0.05 operators will be considered. To be improved in future.
- Some alternate operators may have conflicts in Infrastructure. Please notice if there is "Operator conflict" warnings on the UI, and double check the Infrastructure to shift manually (e.g. some facilities may not have any operator).

### Recruitment Recognition

- Auto-recruitment and recruitment recognition are two different features!
- Auto-recruitment supports using `Expedited Plan` to make it fully automated! Please set it in the settings.
- Pop-up notification when 5★, 6★ operators are recruited.
- Auto-uploading recruitment data to [Penguin Stats](https://penguin-stats.io/) and [Yituliu](https://yituliu.site/) while auto-recruitment.

### Integrated Strategy (I.S.) Support

- Supports recognition of operators and levels, and can choose an optimal solution of operators and skills.
- Supports recognition of shop items, and purchases items that are more valuable.
- Supports auto-reconnecting after disconnection, and replaying after 4 AM.
- The program will abandon the operation and retry if it is stuck by some bug. If it is stuck frequently at some place and has severe impact on efficiency, please submit an issue to us.

- How to get map coordinates: start an operation after filling in `stage_name`. A file named `map.png` will be generated for your reference. Or you can refer to [PRTS.map](https://map.ark-nights.com/), with the `coordinates` set to `MAA` mode.
- Drill plan is recommended for testing.
- Welcome to share your tasks with [www.抄作业.com](https://www.抄作业.com), or [www.prts.plus](https://www.prts.plus)!
- It is recommended to write your own name, video walkthrough URL, or other things that you think helpful in the description.

### Depot Recognition

(Beta) Please start with the `Upgrade materials` screen. Only exporting to several data websites are supported. More features will be added in future.
Please feel free to contact us if you hope to integrate with our JSON schema.

### Miscellaneous

- Tasks order can be changed on the UI. So can the shifting order in the infrastructure.
- Almost all configuration changes will be saved automatically, except for options containing an *.
- All clicking event is randomized within a region, following Poisson distribution (higher probability at the center, lower probability around).
- Developed in C++, the core algorithm supports multi-level cache, in order to reduce CPU and memory usage as much as possible.
- Our software supports auto-update ✿✿ヽ(°▽°)ノ✿ Beta-testers can try beta versions, which updates faster and less buggy (maybe).
- If auto-update fails, you can download manually and put the ZIP file under the same directory. The update will start automatically.

## Other Features

If you need to run multiple instances of emulators, please copy MAA folder, and use **the same ADB** and **different ADB addresses** to connect.
