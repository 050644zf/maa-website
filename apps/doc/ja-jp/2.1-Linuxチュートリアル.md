# Linux Compilation Tutorial

**The tutorial requires some basic knowledge about Linux OS!**

Though it is unclear why it needs to run in Linux... Anyway in case somebody needs it_(:з」∠)_

If you meet any other problems, please feel free to submit issue to us.

> **Note**
> Linux build of MAA is still under discussion, some of the content might be outdated, please follow the script in [GitHub workflow file](../.github/workflows/release-maa-linux.yml)

## Compiling MAA itself only

Download build depends

- Ubuntu/Debian

  ```bash
  sudo apt install gcc-12 g++-12 cmake zlib1g-dev
  ```

- Arch Linux

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S --needed gcc cmake zlib
  ```

Build MAA

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights.git
cd MaaAssistantArknights
mkdir -p build
CC=gcc-12 CXX=g++-12 cmake -B build \
    -DINSTALL_THIRD_LIBS=ON \
    -DINSTALL_RESOURCE=ON \
    -DINSTALL_PYTHON=ON
cmake --build build
```

`cmake` would download `opencv` and `fastdeploy` automatically before compiling by default. Run the following command to install MAA to the target directory after build

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix <target_directory>
```

MAA should be run by setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, do not attempt to install MAA into `/` with superuser privilege.

## Compiling/specifying third-party libraries

Prebuilt `opencv` and `fastdeploy` downloaded by `cmake` may not compatible with all system, if you ran into abi version issue, the following instructions may help.

### OpenCV

Install with package manager of your system, e.g.:

- Ubuntu/Debian

  ```bash
  sudo apt install libopencv libopencv-dev
  # libopencv-dev 可以在编译完成后移除
  ```

- Arch Linux

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S opencv
  ```

Note that MAA on Windows were developed under OpenCV `4.5.3`, if you would like to use specific version or statically link to OpenCV, try to compile from [source](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) .

### FastDeploy

1. Compile and install C++ SDK according to [the tutorial](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/FastDeploy/blob/develop/docs/en/build_and_install/cpu.md), turn on ONNX Runtime (Ort) and Vision switch. Both CPU and GPU version are ok.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/FastDeploy.git
    cd FastDeploy
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DENABLE_ORT_BACKEND=ON \
             -DENABLE_PADDLE_BACKEND=ON \
             -DENABLE_OPENVINO_BACKEND=OFF \
             -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PWD}/compiled_fastdeploy_sdk \
             -DENABLE_VISION=ON \
             -DENABLE_TEXT=OFF \
             -DOPENCV_DIRECTORY=/
    make -j 12
    make install
    ```

    in which `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is the directory to install into, `-DOPENCV_DIRECTORY` should be set to install directory of OpenCV.

### MAA

Similar to above with additional `cmake` argument

```bash
cmake -B build \
    -DINSTALL_THIRD_LIBS=OFF \
    -DOPENCV_DIRECTORY=path_to_opencv_install_prefix \
    -DFASTDEPLOY_DIRECTORY=path_to_compiled_fastdeploy_sdk \
    ...
cmake --build build
```

### Installing and packaging

Dependencies might depends on compilation argument of `opencv` and `fastdeploy`, check manually after `cmake --install`, copy files if needed.
